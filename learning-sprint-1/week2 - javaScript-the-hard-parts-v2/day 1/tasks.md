## Question 1: Functions and Callbacks

Implement a JavaScript function called mapAsync that takes an array and a callback function. 
The function should map each element of the array to a new value using the callback function 
asynchronously. 

The final result should be returned as a Promise.

## Question 2: Call Stack and Recursion

Write a JavaScript function called sumRange that calculates the sum of all integers in a given range. 
The function should use recursion to handle the calculation and demonstrate understanding of the call stack.
