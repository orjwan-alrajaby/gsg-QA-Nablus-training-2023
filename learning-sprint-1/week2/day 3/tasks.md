## Question 1:

You are given a function `executeInSequenceWithCBs` and some code. The task is to
modify the `executeInSequenceWithCBs` function so that it runs and executes all
the tasks inside the asyncTasks array. 

The function should return an array of messages obtained from each task's
execution.

You are only allowed to change the `executeInSequenceWithCBs` function or add new
functions/code. You cannot modify the tasks' functions.

```javascript

const task1 = (cb) => setTimeout(() => {
  const message = "Task 1 has executed successfully!";
  cb(message);
}, 3000)

const task2 = (cb) => setTimeout(() => {
  const message = "Task 2 has executed successfully!";
  cb(message);
}, 0)

const task3 = (cb) => setTimeout(() => {
  const message = "Task 3 has executed successfully!";
  cb(message);
}, 1000)

const task4 = (cb) => setTimeout(() => {
  const message = "Task 4 has executed successfully!";
  cb(message);
}, 2000)

const task5 = (cb) => setTimeout(() => {
  const message = "Task 5 has executed successfully!";
  cb(message);
}, 4000)

const asyncTasks = [task1, task2, task3, task4, task5];

const executeInSequenceWithCBs = (tasks, callback) => {}

```

## Question 2:

You are given a function called `executeInParallelWithPromises`, which takes an
array of APIs (represented by objects). 

Your task is to write code that fetches the data of each API in parallel using
promises. In Parallel means that the api which resolves first, returns its value
first, regardless of the execution order. 

The output of the `executeInParallelWithPromises` function should be an array
containing the results of each API's execution.

Each result should be an object with three keys: `apiName`, `apiUrl`, and
`apiData`..

```javascript
const apis = [
  {
    apiName: "products", 
    apiUrl: "https://dummyjson.com/products",
  }, 
  {
    apiName: "users", 
    apiUrl: "https://dummyjson.com/users",
  }, 
  {
    apiName: "posts", 
    apiUrl: "https://dummyjson.com/posts",
  }, 
  {
    apiName: "comments", 
    apiUrl: "https://dummyjson.com/comments",
  }
]

const executeInParallelWithPromises = (apis) => {}

```

## Question 3: 

You are given a function called `executeInSequenceWithPromises`, which takes an
array of APIs (represented by objects). 

Your task is to write code that fetches the data of each API sequentially (one
after the other) using promises. 

In Sequence means that the api which executes first, returns its value
first.

The output of the `executeInSequenceWithPromises` function should be an array
containing the results of each API's execution.

Each result should be an object with three keys: `apiName`, `apiUrl`, and
`apiData`.

```javascript

const apis = [
  {
    apiName: "products", 
    apiUrl: "https://dummyjson.com/products",
  }, 
  {
    apiName: "users", 
    apiUrl: "https://dummyjson.com/users",
  }, 
  {
    apiName: "posts", 
    apiUrl: "https://dummyjson.com/posts",
  }, 
  {
    apiName: "comments", 
    apiUrl: "https://dummyjson.com/comments",
  }
]

//modify and write your code here
const executeInSequenceWithPromises = (apis) => {}

```
