üìå **IMPORTANT NOTE: To be able to continue this task, you need to have an account
on FreeCodeCamp.**

If you don't already have an account, go ahead and sign up from
[here](https://auth.freecodecamp.org/u/signup/identifier?state=hKFo2SA2OVlFWXpCbWdlN3o3MzBpTWxjZjk1bWItOE1faVI2b6Fur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIGd2REJTNEkwZFMzSHhpUmV3dkh6VUxjT0RxNkpSYmdZo2NpZNkgYVVEdjlqVnFUZnhCUkUxbDYwTkE1QWY3eVRDR0U0Y3k). 

After you sign up and log in, go to the [JavaScript Data Structures and
Algorithms
curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)
and solve **[ALL 26 exercises of the Object Oriented Programming section](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#object-oriented-programming)**.

Since 26 exercises are too many to be documented in github, we're allowing you
to show us your progress on FCC instead.üñ•Ô∏è

In order to make your progress visible on FCC & share it with us, do the following steps:

- At the top-right of your screen, there's a menu button. Click on it. Then
select **Settings**. 
- Scroll down until you reach the **Privacy Settings** section. 
- Under the **Privacy Settings** section, set **My Profile** and **My Timeline**
to be **Public** instead of **Private** as pictured below.üîí

- **Save your new changes**. Without saving, your new changes won't get applied. 
- To check if your progress is public, click on the menu button on the top-right
  of your screen and select **Profile**.
- Now copy the URL of your profile page.
- Open either another browser, or an incognito window on your current browser.
- Paste the URL on the new window/browser and click enter. See if you can see
  your own progress or not. It should look something like the screenshot below.
